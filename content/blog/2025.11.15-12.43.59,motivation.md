I've created several blogs in the past, they all had a short life span. I think it was due to the fact that I started them by the wrong reasons.

This blog pretends to be a log of the things I try and forget, the technical decisions I make. A way to remind myself about certain things.

So I'm hoping this time this blog will last and be a source of continuous reference for me.

May others find it amusing, helpful, but if not, I don't care.
